  &lt;img style=&#34;margin: 5px; float: left;&#34; title=&#34;Why didn&#39;t I think of that&#34; src=&#34;http://img.flipkart.com/bk_imgs/thumb/118/9780471165118.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Why didn&#39;t I think of that&#34; width=&#34;75&#34; height=&#34;100&#34; /&gt;I just found an interesting book in Library I was working in. The book is called &amp;#8220;&lt;a title=&#34;Why didn&#39;t I think of that&#34; href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=EVafPNDvWlYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Why didn&amp;#8217;t I think of that?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; and is written by &lt;em&gt;A. Freeman &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;B. Golden&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;
  Inside you will discover the story of 50 inventions that &amp;#8216;changed&amp;#8217; our society. This book may contain some unknown product for non-US people (like Cuisinart,Frito-Lay, Jello &amp;#8230;) but most of them are known worldwide.Â  You will discover for instance that the yoyo come from the Philippines, that the post-it was not first believed to be useful for 3M &amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;
  The most important aspect of this book (apart from entertaining and culture) is for entrepreneur, managers and inventors. It describes how these products gained their success instead of being just a marketing failure. A lot of examples could help your business to innovate and promote this innovation. I recommend interested people to skim through its pages. The index (in the end) is more usefull than the table of content (quite mysterious for a non-US reader).
&lt;/p&gt;
