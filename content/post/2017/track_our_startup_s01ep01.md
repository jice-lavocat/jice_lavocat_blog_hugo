Let me tell you that writing content that will showcase your brand in a foreign language is not easy… and when you need to talk it’s even worse. If you add the fact that I am French (and you probably know how bad French are in foreign languages…) then you might understand why it took me so long to release a public video for Elokenz.
However, I have wanted to share small bits of stories about how we are building Elokenz for a long time. It all started with the newsletter sent by John Hingley (founder and ex-CEO of Dasheroo). He was committed to summarize every week in a newsletter called ‘Track our Startup’ (and a few days later he publishes the newsletter content on Linkedin Pulse). Long story short, I felt it was great to share an insider view of how the startup was growing and decided to do the same.
