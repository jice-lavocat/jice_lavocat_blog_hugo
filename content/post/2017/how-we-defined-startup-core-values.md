After working with my co-founder, Fanny Arles, for one year, we decided that it was a good time for us to “discover” our company culture as we will soon be expanding our team and want to pave the road for the future and hire like-minded candidates.
Many times companies fail not because of the product, but because of employees or the core team’s misalignment of core values.
Until recently, I had only heard and read about the concept of company culture. I never had to express it with words and jot it down on paper.
