When working on content marketing, adjusting the time you spend between creation and distribution can be difficult. In this posts, several experts give their best tips on how to choose a good balance.


As you start writing blog posts and distributing on various media (social media, communities, forums…) you might wonder how to balance your efforts. Most of the content planning and analysis can be done asynchronously : planning can be done much in advance, and analysis could be scheduled regularly.

However, it’s not the case for content creation and distribution. Most of the time you will tackle them sequentially. You’ll write a post then you’ll distribute it. Though it’s not a fixed rule you might find it more convenient. Moreover, some content have expiration dates, so you have to do the distribution within a certain time frame.
