Content Marketing is known for being really accessible (everyone can do it, registering a domain name for a self hosted wordpress blog is cheap) and can be quite effective if you do it properly, with a purpose and with associated metrics. However, content marketing faces one big issue : it takes a lot of time.

In this post, we’ll try to address the following question : How can a writer track time when working on a blog ? A quick search on Google didn’t bring much material to answer, so I decided to go for the creative approach. I’ll try to define some processes that might be efficient for this task, and to list some associated tools.

This blog post might be read as an introduction to this issue. I will really be happy to provide more advanced tips in the future.
