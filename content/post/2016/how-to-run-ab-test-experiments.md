If you are a little bit interested by digital marketing, you have probably heard of AB testing. This concept allows you to test variations on a webpage to discover which one converts better. The idea is then to run experiment after experiment to improve your conversion rate. Several amazing tools allow you to do that with very few clicks and without headaches. For instance, you can give a look at Visual Website Optimizer, Optimizely or Convert. However, except VWO which is the cheapest with a $49/mo starting plan, most of these tools are not affordable (several thousand dollars per month).

Google Analytics offer a free, but cumbersome alternative. This post is the occasion for me to keep a step by step tutorial on how to get up and running with Google Experiments, the AB testing feature of Google Analytics. I will assume in the following of this post that you are already familiar with Google Analytics (at least you know what this tool does and that you already use it to record your website performance).
