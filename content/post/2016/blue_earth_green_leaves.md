Our planet **Earth** is often called the **Blue Planet** due to the abundant water on its surface and/or the atmospheric hue. Most trees or plants on Earth have **green leaves**. Do you know that if we were living on a different plant, *water would still look blue, while plants might be red, yellow, purple or blue* instead of green ? In this essay I will explain the reason for these 2 colors.

## The Blue Marble

Earth has not ever been called the Blue Planet. In the sixties, first satellites took off the ground and were sent to space. They were the first remote witnesses of our home planet. We already knew the oceans were covering most of the globe, but using 'blue planet' became obvious when we received the pictures sent by these pioneering space devices.

Orbital satellites were [not the first to take pictures](http://www.airspacemag.com/space/the-first-photo-from-space-13721411/) of our round planet : as early as 1946, US engineers sent a rocket to 105km from the ground, with a camera on board. However, the most famous picture is called "The Blue Marble" and was taken on December 7, 1972, by the crew of the **Apollo 17** spacecraft, at a distance of about 45,000 kilometers.

Despite this precise shot does not really illustrate my words, you can easily understand why people call Earth the blue planet. Oceans are spread all over Earth, and from far, it appears mainly Blue.

If aliens exist and come to Earth, the first color they might see from us from far is blue. Blue, the color of the oceans. Blue is the color of our sky.

### Why is our sky and oceans blue ?

Many articles are explaining why our [oceans](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/why-is-earth-blue-6f017e6b6720#.4e71qv57s) full of life and [our](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering#Reason_for_the_blue_color_of_the_sky) [sky](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html) are blue. Two distinct phenoma are in action here. The first one is **light absorption** , the second **light scattering**.

The sky, our atmosphere, is made of gazes : small partcules floating around because they are tiny and light. When a light beam hits such particules, it's direction is "disturbed" by the particule. This is called **scattering** (and my former [Research Team](http://www.lens.unifi.it/complexphotonics/) was studying scattering of light in random media). So, to give a very brief explaination, various material have various scattering properties. Those from the sky have the property of scattering more blu-ish light than anything else. And, given that our color vision have more sensibility to the blue than the purple, we mainly see a blue sky.

The ocean, as you know is mainly made of water. The chemical composition of water is H2O, which means that this molecule contains 2 Hydrogen atoms and 1 Oxygen atom. When light is going through a material (solid, liquid or gas) it can be absorbed if photons cross path with atoms. The **absorption of photons** depends on the the type of molecules: for some molecule red photons are absorbed, while for other molecules it could be green or blue. The water molecule is absorbing red, orange and yellow photons, the other colors are reflected. So, on the average, water look more blue than any other hues.

So, our sky is blue because of scattering (which depends on the type of molecules and their concentration) while our oceans are blue because of absorption (which depends only on the type of molecules).


## Let's change planet - Blue oceans, Green sky, Red leaves

Let's now travel in space and go to a distant, Earth-like planet. The temperature and climate allows water to be present in its three states and life emerged millions of years ago. If you were to walk on the shore of this imaginary planet, you would first see the blue ocean. You would also be walking on a yellow sand. All this could remind you of your last Summer vacation at the beach.

However, by looking around, you would notice something strange. Behind the white clouds, the sky is looking unfamiliar. Instead of uniform blue hue, you see that it's mainly greenish now. On Earth, the Sun looks white/yellow, but here, the local star is more orange.

Another stricking fact is that plants here have red leaves! If you turn around you will see that bushes and trees all exhibit a ruby color.

Despite all this being surnatural to you, this whole landscape can depict a real situation. Let me try to explain a few things

### Blue oceans

Water molecules will always absorb photons in the same way. So, it will always looks blue; the deeper, the bluer. However, similarly to what can be found on Earth, some compounds ( impurities, algae) can change the color of water. You might have heard of the Red Tide phenomenon which is due to an algea bloom and turn the ocean to a red sea:

Algae can also turn water to glow. Bioluminescence is the biochemical emission of light by living organisms such as glow-worms and deep-sea fish. Phytoplankton is the smallest form of an algae, and it's found in all oceans. Some phytoplankton exhibit bioluminescence defensive behaviour. When water is moving unusally, when the natural flow is disturbed near the organism, it emits light to protect agains predators. This explain why waves can create beautiful night sceneries like the following one in *Fajardo*, Puerto Rico.

### Green Sky

The light scattering effect that makes our sky blue is called Rayleigh scattering and is due to smaller than light particles. This physical effect is predominant in every atmosphere and impacts shorter wavelenghts (blue) more than longer wavelength (red). This means that blue photons get more scattered than red.

If the atmosphere get thicker or thiner, or if the density changes, the scattering properties will not be the same. If you also change the light spectrum of the source (the local star) you might come up with a sky that is slightly different than the Earth blue sky.

To get a sense of the various tones the sky can show, you can look at a dawn sky above the ocean. As sunlight needs to travel more through the atmosphere, the scattering gets so high that most photons are "lost" and now a majority of longer wavelengths reaches your eyes. You can understand this process easier [with this sketch](/images/posts/2016/blue_planet/scattering.png).

### Red leaves

The direct light received on Earth is called white light and it contains infra-red, visible and UV wavelenghts. The spectrum is continuous, which means we receive all wavelengths. However, due to the Sun's emission and the absorption by the atmosphere the energy received is not homogeneous for all wavelengths.

An engineer with a mission to collect energy from the Sun would use the previous graph to tune and adjust his device (let's call it "solar panel"). His device would probably absorb several wavelengths and the engineer would try to optimize so that more energy is absorbed.

In the best scenario, the device would absorb all wavelengths. This means that no color would be reflected... this also means that the solar panel appears black. Nature is said to be the best engineer, so why isn't there black leaves out there? Why are the leaves around us green?

Well, you probably know that the green color from leaves comes from a dye called [Chlorophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll) that enables photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis converts the Sun energy into chemical energy. Leaves have several types of chlorophyll.
