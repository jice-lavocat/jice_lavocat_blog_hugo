Over the years, the web got **biased** toward **content with shorter and shorter lifetime**.

When I started browsing the Internet 15 years ago, personal **websites were delivering knowledge**. There was a huge amount of websites made by passionate people, where authors talked about their hobbies, about their jobs, about their skills. Nowadays, people **create and share disposable information** more than anything else. What is important is to get visitors, to be noticed, to shock readers, to be "shared" on social networks.

This post is an **opinion** I am sharing with you. In two or three years from now, I might have changed my mind about this written opinion, either slightly or completely. This opinion is built on **emotions**. Emotions are quite volatile. Emotions help to build an opinion. In two or three days from now, my current emotions will probably be gone. Most of the time, emotions are triggered by **facts**. Facts are reported for a given context : a location, a date, single or several subjects.

The point I want to make here is that this post has an expected **validity lifespan** of a few years. On the contrary, what has been written down in my PhD thesis will (hopefully) stay valid for many years. In there I put **knowledge** : pieces of information that took some time to be created, developed then verified, and finally saved (as words). This knowledge was also build upon facts, but these **facts were assembled in a comprehensive framework**. The framework provides a minimum valid context to facts and explains how various facts are bound together.

Reporting facts, conveying an opinion and sharing knowledge have been the building blocks of our civilizations since the invention of language.

Today I'll write down some ideas I got lately about a phenomenon that got me a little disappointed somehow. I decided to write this just after Ann Smarty, CEO of MyBlogU, posted the following Facebook status :

    Thanks to Facebook, I know about lots of weird, funny, heart-breaking, etc moments in life, history and politics: But these are just these: Moments. Taken out of context, forming my perspective in one way or another...

    How many of us now know why the war started (and who to blame) but not how it continued? (Because we scrolled through that update and the news never crossed our path ever again)... How many of us formed our opinions about something or something because of the stupid visual quote taken out of context (Or, in most cases, never even really pronounced)?

    Yes, thanks to Twitter and Facebook, I know much more about the world today (I know about presidents and their workout routines, two-legged puppies, huge waves, cats pooping into human toilets...) but with that much wider knowledge, how much more ...ummm... shallow do I become?

But this is not only related to social networks. I think the change is broader than that. It's about the Web in general.

## The information-sickness era
Knowledge, Opinions and Facts both are information. Though the term greatly evolves an **information** is now more generic and retained the sense of **something that might be offered or exchanged to someoneâ€™s advantage**. An information gives you the advantage over those who are ignorants. To get information faster, Rome built *roads* about 500BC : this allowed decision-makers to act in a wiser way. To get more consistent information, *Gutenberg* introduced *mechanical printing* in Europe in the 15th century. Later followed the inventions of the *radio*, *television* and finally the *Internet*. People who access such media get an amazing advantage over those who don't.

Nowadays, speed stopped being a limitation. Though the use of *undersea optical cables*, we reached a physical upper limit. Information cannot travel faster than light. Well ... physical laws can be discussed here, but that's for another article.

So, we can't get information faster than today ! This great situation, triggered a new civilization paradigm : **we are now drowned under information and need to develop Artificial Intelligence to classify it and extract important knowledge out of it**. This is an interesting topic too and would probably be discussed in another post.

In this essay, I want to focus on the impact of web created content.

## Tools are evolving toward the instant-web

I started publishing content on the web in late 1990. The term blog (from weblogging) didn't really exist yet. Ordering content by date was not common on personal websites. People were mostly adding new pages to their websites and added a link in the main menu for visitors to browse the page. Most of the time, content was organized in categories and you had to browse the parent category first to have access to the interesting content.

The **Web was more static**. Dynamic languages (PHP) rose and CMS got developed. I coded my own CMS (today you would call that a blog probably) in 2002. At that time, my content was not organized in a timely manner, instead it was still using categories to navigate. I guess that I got some traffic (maybe 10 visitors a day... that was huge then) and signed up on an ad platforms. Offers got sent to publishers on a weekly frequency. Publishers had to select which campaigns they wanted to run on their websites and manually insert the graphical banner.

I will always remember that day I received an add for a 'weblog' platform. The term was completely new to me, here in France. I reacted in a way that took me 14 years to understand. I saw this ad offer and said : "This *webblog thing* is just bullshit. Who will ever visit a website with stacked content that gets buried overtime ? People like organized content, this is just easier to read and consume."

... and you know what happens next for blogs. They didn't disappear. Instead they flourished and almost every personal website turned to a blog version. Systems like **RSS feeds** appeared to help getting track of newly created content. CMS like **Wordpress** created such a revolution than even showcase websites use them to display 1 or 2 pages.

For better or for worst static webpages disappeared. Not surprisingly, this did not happen on a wide scale for academic research though. If you happen to browse an internationally known professor's homepage someday, you will likely see pages with a dense amount of knowledge (and links to publications), but rarely a blog with dynamic content. **Knowledge lasts longer and takes time to be created**. Knowledge is expensive.

The trend didn't stop after the uprising of blogging. It continued with **social networks**, sometime also known as **micro blogging** tools. People call that web 2.0 since it offered the publication power to the masses.

### what happened in the instant-web ?

More messages were produced and shared. These messages were competing for the audience. Therefore they were produced quicker, . The public can daily see a content waterfall on his screen.

## Toward an equilibrium with the Web of Knowledge

## Other type of informations : news,  ?

-
## Why has it been biased so much?
- Google freshness : new content rank higher
- social virality : emotions spread better
