With a rather short-notice announcement on October 18th, the simple but effective social media automation tool Twitterfeed  declared that they will be shutting doors on October 31st, 2016. Why this happens, and what to do if you were a user is an important topic for those who want to keep sharing their RSS feed to their social accounts.

What is Twitterfeed

Twitterfeed was a great tool, altogether simple and efficient. The idea was pretty obvious : Twitterfeed helped users to share new blogs posts to their social accounts by using their RSS feed. The configuration was one of the simplest : you synced your social accounts, then your added your RSS feeds, and that was it. No more fuss, all your new content was automatically shared to Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin.
