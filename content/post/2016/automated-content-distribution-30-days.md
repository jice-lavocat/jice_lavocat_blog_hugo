In this article, we’ll describe an experiment we ran during the Summer : we used Repost, our content distribution tool, to automate the social distribution of my wife’s Blog. It’s a early case-study of a strategy that lead to nearly 5K visitors over a month, without doing anything. Half of her traffic came from the tool during the Summer !

Our Experiment and Results
When you get hooked by a Inbound.org experiment

I am a huge fan of Inbound.org community. A while ago, we noticed a post by Tami Brehse (@tamibrehse) titled “I Automated My Tweets for 30 Days and This is What Happened“. I was immediately attracted by the post because it described an experiment Tami was doing manually, and that she could have done with the tool we were developing at the time.
