Since I will soon have to **transfer my money from an USD** ($) **bank account** (Wells-Fargo) to France (in EUR €), I had to look around to find the best solution. With the help of one friend, I started discovering some solutions last year ; but none of them were satisfying. I thus looked a little bit more on forums and found two interesting threads. One is unfortunately in French (google translate it if you want) , but hopefully the most interesting one is in English.

  1. [http://philadelphieaccueil.superforum.fr/t1271-transfert-d-argent-des-usa-vers-la-france-a-moindre-frais][1] &#8211; read the 4th message ([English Translation][2])
  2. <http://www.pomsinadelaide.com/forum/money-finance/19410-did-you-use-www-currencyonline-com.html> &#8211; more interesting

My quest for bank/currency transfers came through &#8216;bank-to-bank&#8217; transfers, &#8216;Western Union&#8217;, [Paypal][3] and [XOOM][4]. But the final solution I found was to use a dedicated online transfer company. There exist several of them (part of them listed in the second link above). I also followed the advice of [Mark Xpnist][5] and asked for a quotation to the following three companies :

  * [http://www.satworldwide.co.uk][7]
  * [http://www.currencyonline.com][8]

I will try to find time to update this blogpost as soon as I have some replies.

\___\_____ EDIT &#8211; March 14th \___\___\___\____

I decided to test &#8216;Currency Online&#8217; (I picked up this one at random). In order to test the service, I first prepared a payment of $100 USD to EUR . Two fees were applied on my payment. The first one comes from Currency Online, the second comes from my bank.

  1. Currency Online will charge a fee on bank transfer that are less than $5000 USD worth. Above that amount, there will be no fee.
  2. Wells Fargo will charge $3 USD for a transfer below $2000 to a non wells fargo  account. Above that amount, the fee increases to $10.

So, for my $100 USD transfer, I finally had to pay $107.

Next time, I plan to transfer >$5000 &#8230; so I will pay $10.
