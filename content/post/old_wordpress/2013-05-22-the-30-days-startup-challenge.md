  I have not been writing on my blog for many months now. This was probably to learn more and more from online readings and share experience with friends. As you may know, I am still working on PhD degree (Italy//Spain) in the field of nanotechnologies. However, I recently decided to try a <strong>quick and intensive challenge</strong>. Let&#8217;s call it the « <strong> 30-days startup challenge</strong>  ».
</p>

## The 30-days startup challenge

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As you guess from the title, I will dedicate 30 days in the <strong>creation of a web startup</strong>&#8230; Well, I should say 30 evenings since my days are booked in the lab. I will try to dedicate some time after each milestone reached, to write a summary on my blog. To follow my adventures, you can <strong>register to the mailing list</strong> below.
</p>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  All kind of help will be appreciated from you, so do not hesitate to <strong>comment, criticize, share, and talk about my project</strong>. At the moment the project has barely started so I don&#8217;t feel a lot of pressure, but later I guess I would be tempted to stop, so your help will be the strongest motivation I could receive.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I will try to make this experience as much <strong>pedagogical</strong> as possible. At the end of each blog post you will find a table with a summary of different numbers :<em> time spent, money spent, money received, people involved</em>.
</p>

## Step 0  : The idea

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  To make a long story short, let&#8217;s summarize the project and day 0 (Monday 20th May).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  First, the project has two main targets  : <strong>content producers</strong> (journalists, web copyrighter,s bloggers) and <strong>publishers/brand promoters</strong> (e-magazine, webmasters, SEO agencies, and PR agencies).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Here is the value proposition for each market segment  :
</p>

  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For writers</span>  : Promoting your writing skills and expertise and providing you with job offers and clients
  * For publishers  : Finding the best writer for your business

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is the end of the first post. In the next post, I will explain you how I selected the<strong> name of the startup</strong>.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">
