The book is called &#8220;<a title="Why didn't I think of that" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EVafPNDvWlYC&printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">Why didn&#8217;t I think of that?</a>&#8221; and is written by <em>A. Freeman </em>and <em>B. Golden</em>.

  Inside you will discover the story of 50 inventions that &#8216;changed&#8217; our society. This book may contain some unknown product for non-US people (like Cuisinart,Frito-Lay, Jello &#8230;) but most of them are known worldwide.Â  You will discover for instance that the yoyo come from the Philippines, that the post-it was not first believed to be useful for 3M &#8230;

  The most important aspect of this book (apart from entertaining and culture) is for entrepreneur, managers and inventors. It describes how these products gained their success instead of being just a marketing failure. A lot of examples could help your business to innovate and promote this innovation. I recommend interested people to skim through its pages. The index (in the end) is more usefull than the table of content (quite mysterious for a non-US reader).
