[<img class="alignleft" alt="zoo joomla module" src="/images/posts/oldwordpress/uploads/2011/08/zoo.png" width="150" height="120" />][1]I wanted to add a <a title="Google plus" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/" target="_blank">google +1 button</a> to my website. As I am using YOOtheme zoo CCK component, I add to create a new &#8220;element&#8221; to be print at the end of my blog post. You can download it bellow. Of course you can use it on any zoo applications (blogs, businesses, recipes &#8230; and custom applications).

### How to install

Download the archive : [ZOOelement Googleplus][2]

Then, unzip the files in your folder : _/base\_installation\_folder/media/zoo/elements._ You will see a new folder named &#8220;googleplus&#8221;.

### How to setup

You can configure all the options except the language. To change the language, you&#8217;ll need to do it by yourself and modify your global template.

To add the google +1 button to a content, go to your zoo configuration panel, and select the application where you want this button to appear. Modify the elements appearing in this type of applications, and add the &#8220;Google +1&#8243;. The configuration is pretty transparent.

### Note

In the case you are using this button without printing the number of +1s, I took the privilege of adding a small modification to the code, to promote my websites. One out of 10 buttons will actually be +1ing one of my websites. If you want to remove it, it&#8217;s up to you, but you could also considering it as a small reward for the time I spent on it for you.

### Questions

Don&#8217;t hesitate to post comment for precisions or bug corrections.
